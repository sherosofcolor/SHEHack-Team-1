## Overview  
SHEdule is a smart scheduling platform designed to help women balance work, health, and personal life by considering the physiological changes associated with their menstrual cycle. Unlike traditional scheduling apps that focus only on productivity, SHEdule provides balanced recommendations by suggesting activities across different categories like mental health, physical health, productivity, and leisure, and also suggesting alternate cycle-aware activities. It features a smart AI assistant that guides a user through their body's natural rhythm. 


### Inspiration behind your project  
We were inspired by the challenges that women face in balancing work and health, especially when dealing with the cyclical changes of their bodies. Research shows that menstrual phases impact energy levels, physicla and emotional well-being — yet existing scheduling tools fail to address these variations. SHEdule fills this gap by providing tailored recommendations that align with the user’s cycle phase and overall well-being.  

### Impact of the Solution  
- **Personalized Scheduling** – Tailors daily schedules based on the user's menstrual cycle phase.  
- **Smart Activity Recommendations** – Suggests activities across four categories to create a balanced day.  
- **AI-Based Adjustments** – Recommends alternative activities based on cycle phase and user preferences.  
- **Persisting State** – Automatically saves progress and activity status across sessions.  
- **Health Awareness** – Provides suggestions for food, exercise, and rest based on the user’s phase.
